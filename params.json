  "body": "# My first project is based on analizing a billboard that collects the top 100 tracks during 1999-2000:\r\n\r\n                    ![uu](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3114/2524849923_1c191ef42e.jpg)\r\n\r\n## The first step is to understand how to process the data and which variables will be modified. All the columns that contain dates, times... using tools such as datetime, those variables will be modified and ready to work with them. From week 65 to the end of our database, all the columns are empty because there are no ranking registered for each one of our tracks. All these columns will be erased from our database.\r\n\r\n## The second step is start calculating parameters in our database such as the difference between the date when the track is entered in the billboard and the date when the track reach the peak in the ranking. That will show us how much time it takes for each track to reach the peak in the ranking. Another option that will help to understand our database is creating new columns that will group each track by the month they entered/reached the peak in the billboard.\r\n\r\n## The third step is drawing plots so it's easier to understand all the data that is processed:\r\n\r\n### Sum of songs that entered in the billboard grouped by months:\r\n\r\n![Songs entering billboard by month](C:\\Users\\alexrebull\\Pictures\\cancionesentra.jpg)\r\n\r\n### In each month, the length of the tracks grouped by genre:\r\n\r\n![length of the tracks grouped by genre](C:\\Users\\alexrebull\\Pictures\\genreentra.jpg)\r\n\r\n### How much time it takes to reach the peak of the billboard once the track enter(grouped by genre, time in days):\r\n\r\n![time(in days) that takes to reach the peak](C:\\Users\\alexrebull\\Pictures\\timepeak.jpg)\r\n\r\n## The fourth step is checking all the processed data and plots and understanding the meaning of the data. From the database:\r\n* Rock is the predominant genre\r\n* R&B and Rap are the ones from the top4 genres that reach the peak faster\r\n* Jazz and Gospel are the most unpopular and the ones with longest tracks\r\n\r\n\r\n# Working in this project was helpful because it allowed me to understand more the mechanics of using pandas and other tools to process all my data. In the next week I will keep posting the new projects I will be working on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
